## How to use this image

Assumed you had a Trac environment folder named 'demo' in your current working directory, You can simply run by following command:

    $ docker run -d -v $PWD:/trac gasolwu/trac:1.2

The Trac standalone server will run on port 80 by default.

If you haven't own the Trac environment, You can create one by command `initenv`:

    $ docker run -u $(id -u) -v $PWD:/trac gasolwu/trac:1.2 initenv demo
    $ tree -C demo/
    demo/

## How to install Trac plugins

You can extend this image to install 3rd-party plugins for customization, or, Connect to the running container by `docker exec` and install plugins on attached shell for the purpose of testing.

This image provides another way for that, You must list the plugins you want to install in an file, This file is best known as `requirements.txt` in general, Put the file in a directory which should be mount as docker volume, and then tell the image where it is via `PIP_REQUIREMENTS_FILE` environment variable.

Example for XmlRpcPlugin installation:

    $ cat > requirements.txt <<EOF
    TracXMLRPC==1.1.8
    EOF
    $ docker run -it --rm -e PIP_REQUIREMENTS_FILE=/trac/requirements.txt -v $PWD:/trac gasolwu/trac:1.2 admin /trac/demo
